I’ll be presenting at the APS DFD Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, UT, on my work, *Learning Stochastic Closures via Conditional Diffusion 
Model and Neural Operator*. This project was selected for [DFD-Interact](https://dfd-meeting.aps.org/attendees-presenters/dfd-interact), 
which features only the most exciting submissions. I’ll be at 
[Session C02: Interact: Machine Learning in Fluids](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD24/Session/C02.10) from 10:50 AM - 12:50 PM on November 24. Stop by and say hi!
