  abstract={Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.},

  abstract={Morrey Conjecture deals with two properties of functions which are known as quasi-convexity and rank-one convexity. It is well established that every function satisfying the quasi-convexity property also satisfies rank-one convexity. Morrey (1952) conjectured that the reversed implication will not always hold. In 1992, Vladimir Sverak found a counterexample to prove that Morrey Conjecture is true in three dimensional case. The planar case remains, however, open and interesting because of its connections to complex analysis, harmonic analysis, geometric function theory, probability, martingales, differential inclusions and planar non-linear elasticity. Checking analytically these notions is a very difficult task as the quasi-convexity criterion is of non-local type, especially for vector-valued functions. That's why we perform some numerical simulations based on a gradient descent algorithm using Dacorogna and Marcellini example functions. Our numerical results indicate that Morrey Conjecture holds true.},
