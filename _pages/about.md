**Research:** I develop efficient data-driven models for complex systems that are multi-scale, multi-physics, and chaotic in nature. My current research focuses on stochastic modeling using advanced generative approaches, including diffusion models, flow matching, and their variants. I am also interested in nonlocal modeling and continuous spatiotemporal representations.
<!-- My goal is to make foundational advancements in the theory, methods, and algorithms of generative AI and SciML. My current research focuses on (score-based) diffusion models with applications in complex dynamical systems that are multi-scale, multi-physics, and chaotic in nature. Additionally, my work extends to significant involvement and broad interests in data-driven modeling, computational fluid dynamics, and optimization. -->

**Previously:** I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computing from [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/). I spent a few months working on proving the [Morrey's Conjecture](https://www.ias.edu/video/morreys-conjecture) by providing several [numerical examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11194).
