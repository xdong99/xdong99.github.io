My current research focuses on (score-based) diffusion models with applications in complex dynamical systems that are multi-scale, multi-physics, and chaotic in nature. Additionally, my work extends to significant involvement and broad interests in data-driven modeling, computational fluid dynamics, and optimization.</p> <p><strong>Previously:</strong> I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computing from <a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</a>, where I worked on proving the <a href="https://www.ias.edu/video/morreys-conjecture" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Morrey’s Conjecture</a> by providing several <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11194" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">numerical examples</a>.</p> </body></html>
