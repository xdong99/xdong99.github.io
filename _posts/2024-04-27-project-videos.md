Here I am incluing some animations related to my Continuous and Stochastic Surrogate Modeling project. The first video is to illustrate the significance of the modeled term G.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/Animation3050NoG.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
        <div class="caption">
            Animations of the true vorticity field and the vorticity with G removed from 30s to 50s. <br>
            Left: true vorticity. Right: vorticity without G. 
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/Animation3040Final.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}
        <div class="caption">
            Animations of the true vorticity field and simulated vorticity field from 30s to 40s. <br>
            Left: true vorticity. Right: simulated vorticity.
