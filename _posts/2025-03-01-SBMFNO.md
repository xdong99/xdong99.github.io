## Introduction
Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models usually lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields. 

## Closure in Complex Dynamical Systems
Consider a dynamical system whose general governing equation is given by:
$$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:true_system}
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = M(v),
\end{equation}
$$
where $$v$$ represents the full system state and $$M$$ encompasses the dynamics derived from first principles, which can include highly nonlinear mappings, differential operators, and integral operators. In practice, resolving every detail of $$v$$ numerically is often impractical, which motivates the use of a reduced-order system:
$$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:model_system}
    \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = \widetilde{M}(V),
\end{equation}
$$
with $$V := \mathcal{K}(v)$$ denoting a reduced-order representation of $$v$$, where the mapping $$\mathcal{K}$$ extracts the essential information for numerical simulation. Here, $$\widetilde{M}(V)$$ is constructed based on domain knowledge to approximate the reduced dynamics $$\mathcal{K} \circ M(v)$$, resulting in a closed system in terms of $$V$$ that is tractable for practical computations.

To enhance the performance of traditional closure models $$\widetilde{M}$$, researchers have recently introduced a machine-learning-based correction term $$U$$, aiming for the modified model $$\widetilde{M}(V) + U$$ to more accurately capture the true reduced-order dynamics.

## Conditional Diffusion Model Framework
In this work, we focus on a stochastic variant of the correction term $$U$$, enabled by recent advances in diffusion models. Diffusion models gradually add noise to data via a forward process, then learn to reverse the process to generate samples that mimic the original data distribution. In this work, we use the score-based diffusion model, which learns the gradient of the log probability density (the “score”) rather than the probability density itself. This formulation bypasses the need for a normalizing constant and makes the training process more tractable <d-cite key="song2020score"></d-cite>. Specifically, our goal is to approximate the distribution $$p(U)$$ and to sample from it efficiently. It is important to note that $$U$$ often depends on the current state $$V$$ as well as additional information—such as the temporal history of $$V$$ or spatially non-local data. Hence, we denote all such auxiliary information by $$\mathrm{y}$$ and concentrate on a conditional diffusion model framework targeting the approximation and efficient sampling of $$p(U \mid \mathrm{y})$$. By adopting this stochastic viewpoint, the model can naturally account for the uncertainty and variability inherent in unresolved scales. This probabilistic treatment is also especially important in systems where past states influence current dynamics—a phenomenon known as non-Markovian behavior.

## Leveraging Fourier Neural Operators

One of the major innovations in this work is the incorporation of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to build the score function. Unlike traditional neural networks that operate on discretized data, FNOs work directly with continuous spatiotemporal fields. This confers two major advantages:

1. **Resolution Invariance:** FNOs allow the model to generalize across different grid resolutions. This is particularly useful when training data might be available at one resolution while simulations require finer scales

2. **Non-Local Modeling:** Because FNOs operate in the Fourier domain, they inherently capture global interactions within the field. This makes them well-suited to model non-local effects, which are critical when the closure term depends on long-range interactions in the system.

The neural operator architecture seamlessly integrates multiple data inputs—such as the current vorticity field and sparse measurements of the true closure term—into the score-based diffusion framework.

## More to come.

## Accelerating the Sampling Process

A well-known drawback of standard diffusion models is their slow sampling speed. In typical image generation tasks, diffusion models may require hundreds or even thousands of iterative steps to generate a sample. For closure modeling, where a new sample is needed at every time step of a numerical simulation, such computational cost becomes impractical.

To overcome this, the authors introduce a fast sampling strategy that employs adaptive time stepping. Instead of using uniform step sizes, the reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) is solved with step sizes that decrease as the simulation approaches the final state. This adaptive scheme, illustrated in Eq. (20) *(placeholder: refer to Eq. (20) in the paper)*, dramatically reduces the number of required steps—by as much as a factor of 100—without compromising sample quality. Accelerated sampling is critical for integrating the diffusion model into real-time simulation loops, as demonstrated in the later sections of the paper (see **Figs. 14 and 16** *(placeholders: insert Figs. 14 and 16 here)*).

## Numerical Experiments: Turbulence Simulation in 2-D Navier–Stokes

To validate their framework, the authors consider a classic problem: simulating turbulent flows using the 2-D Navier–Stokes equations in vorticity form. The simulation domain is set on a torus, and the problem is designed to reflect realistic scenarios where unresolved dynamics play a crucial role. Two distinct closure scenarios are studied:

### 1. Stochastic Viscous Diffusion Term (\( G(x,t) \))
This term is linear and local. Initial experiments conditioning solely on the current vorticity field (see **Fig. 3** *(placeholder: insert Fig. 3 here)*) revealed significant discrepancies between the generated samples and the ground truth. However, by incorporating sparse measurements of the true diffusion term—upscaled via bicubic interpolation or 2-D convolution—the model’s performance improved substantially (see **Figs. 4 and 5** *(placeholders: insert Figs. 4 and 5 here)*). The enhanced conditioning enables the diffusion model to focus on regimes of high correlation, reducing the overall error.

### 2. Stochastic Convection Term (\( H(x,t) \))
In contrast, the convection term is both nonlinear and non-local. Despite the inherently larger magnitude of the convection effects (which helps reduce the relative impact of noise), conditioning solely on the current vorticity still led to errors (see **Fig. 6** *(placeholder: insert Fig. 6 here)*). Again, augmenting the conditioning input with sparse observations of the convection term significantly improved the accuracy of the generated fields (see **Figs. 7 and 8** *(placeholders: insert Figs. 7 and 8 here)*).

## Resolution Invariance and Energy Spectra

A standout feature of the framework is its resolution invariance. Although the models are trained on a fixed resolution (64×64), they can be successfully tested on finer resolutions (128×128 and 256×256) without a loss in performance. This is a direct benefit of using FNOs, which operate on continuous functions. **Figs. 9–12** *(placeholders: insert Figs. 9 to 12 here)* illustrate that the overall patterns of the generated closure terms remain consistent across different resolutions. Furthermore, the energy spectrum comparisons in **Fig. 13** *(placeholder: insert Fig. 13 here)* show that the generated fields capture the correct distribution of energy across different wavenumbers—a crucial aspect when modeling turbulent flows.

## Integrating the Closure Model into Simulations

The ultimate test of any closure model is its ability to improve simulation accuracy. The authors integrate the trained diffusion models into a pseudo-spectral solver for the 2-D Navier–Stokes equations. They simulate the vorticity field \( \omega(x,t) \) over time and compare three scenarios:

- **Neglecting the Closure Term:** Simulations without any closure model show significant deviations from the true dynamics.
- **Using Generated Closure Terms:** When the stochastic closure terms (either \( G \) or \( H \)) generated by the diffusion models are included, the simulated vorticity fields align much more closely with the ground truth.
- **Comparison of Sampling Strategies:** By experimenting with different reverse SDE sampling frequencies and step-size strategies (as detailed in Tables 7 and 8 and **Fig. 15** *(placeholders: insert Tables 7, 8, and Fig. 15 here)*), the authors demonstrate that their adaptive scheme strikes an excellent balance between computational efficiency and accuracy.

The improved accuracy of the vorticity simulations underscores the potential of using data-driven stochastic closure models in practice. Not only does the framework capture complex dynamical behaviors, but it also does so with a computational cost that makes it viable for real-world applications.

## Concluding Thoughts and Future Directions

The research by Dong, Chen, and Wu marks a significant step forward in the field of closure modeling. By merging conditional diffusion models with Fourier Neural Operators, the authors have devised a framework that can handle both the stochastic and non-local aspects of unresolved dynamics in complex systems. The ability to accelerate the sampling process makes the method practical for integration into numerical simulation pipelines, paving the way for more accurate and efficient models of turbulent flows and other multiscale phenomena.

Looking ahead, there are several exciting directions for future work:
- **Extension to 3-D Flows:** While the current study focuses on two-dimensional flows, extending the approach to three-dimensional simulations could have profound implications for high-fidelity turbulence modeling.
- **Integration of Physical Constraints:** Incorporating more detailed physical laws and constraints into the training process might further enhance model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Application to Other Domains:** Beyond fluid dynamics, this data-driven stochastic closure framework could be adapted to a wide range of applications, from climate modeling to material science, wherever multiscale interactions play a crucial role.

In summary, this innovative approach provides a compelling example of how modern machine learning methods can enhance traditional simulation techniques. By embracing the inherent uncertainty in complex systems and using advanced generative models to capture it, researchers are opening up new possibilities for predictive modeling in challenging scientific and engineering domains.
